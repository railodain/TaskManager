Task Manager

My project is a program for organizing tasks, and finding which one to work on currently.

It's interface is a chatbot-style function 'start_working()', which prompts the user to select from five methods of the class TaskInventory by inputing the following given commands according to a prompt:

1. Input task: Adds a new task to the instance of TaskInventory

2. Mark task completed: Removes tasks with inputed name from the instance of 
TaskInventory.

3. Get schedule: Prints the list of tasks, ordered by due date.

4. Get recommended task: Returns the soonest due task that suits the user's current level of focus.

5. Rest for now: End the chat function.
